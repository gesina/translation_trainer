MOTIVATION
**************************

The Translation Trainer is intended to be a little assistant for
those who like reading texts in foreign languages but still have
problems with the vocabulary.
The main idea is to ensure that no ongoing looking up words in a
dictionary or googling them interrupts the studies of the text.
One will (hopefully) find this intention reflected in the rather
simple than overloaded or distracting design made mainly for
reader-friendly screen-sizes and in eye-frienly brightness.

The Page is based on AJAX-queries to Glosbe-Dictionary, the only
really working and large enough free online dictionary with
AJAX-support I could find:

https://glosbe.com/



STRUCTURE
**************************
Code as well as page are roughly structured in:

#1 INPUT
   a) text input:
      - elements: text input field, button "GO"
      - text extraction:
      	     * splitting input text in sections of MAX_PARLENGTH=2000 (split_str)
	     * save sections in sessionStorage (store_par)
	     * create next visible section (create_output):
	        extracts via Regular Expressions every word out of the
   	        given text, puts it in a <span> and this into a <div> with
   		class word_div; no word charakters are inserted
   		inbetween;
   b) file extraction:
      - elements: input type file, button "Load"
      -  first gets the text via FileReader obj:
	     * recursively reads all files in the input-list
	     * rest same as above
   c) language selection:
      - elements: seletion tags in the navigation bar and two text inputs
      - individual language select is possible through option "type
         ..." which triggers the correspondent input field to
   	 show; input has to be the according ISO 639-3 language code;
   	 (langfrom, langto); 
      

#2 TRANSLATION OUTPUT (for translation bar on the left and the words):
   a) init of translation <div> for touched word:
      - creation only on first touch or if language has changed
      	(init_transl, create_transl)
   b) AJAX-query for word the cursor touched:
      - generate needed settings (settings, get_data_Glosbe,
      	within button_transl00-event)
      - send to Glosbe-Dictionary
   c) interpretation (interpret_data_Glosbe):
      - workaround for Glosbe's case sensitivity
      - picking of every given translation with examples and
      	descriptions:
		* create list element with click-binding to being
   		  added to vocab sheet	
		* each in one li and this in the translation list;
		* if none available giving warning;
    d) display:
       - display dependend on cursor position:
       	 	 * above half of word: container above
		 * below half of word: container below

#3 VOCABULARY
   a) input:
      - from every word-translation-container (also the one on the
      	left) by clicking translation
      - from alternative input field in word-translation-containern
      	(individual translations for given word)
      - from alternative input under "Vocab"
      	(individual entry, also notes)
   b) deletion:
      - individually: "X"-button in voc_div
      - all: "clear all"-button
   c) HTML-download:
      - creation of the text for the new HTML-file (without JavaScript)
        (download_html_style, html_prefix, html_suffix, vocab_to_html)
      - download via URI-encoded link (create_vocab_download)
